| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |

| **Real-time Monitoring** | Get an at-a-glance view of Jules's current work status (`Running`, `Active`, `Done`, etc.) in a dedicated sidebar view. No more switching back and forth between your browser and editor.                          | `julesSessionsView`                 |
| **Progress Update**      | Curious about how far Jules has progressed? Click the `‚Üª` (refresh) button to instantly fetch and display the latest session status and activity list.                                                             | `jules-extension.refreshSessions`   |
| **Activity Display**     | Select a session to view detailed logs of the commands Jules has executed, files it has edited, and its thought process. It provides a transparent development experience, as if you're peering into Jules's mind. | `jules-extension.showActivities`    |
| **Refresh Activities**   | Update the activities view for the current session to see the latest progress.                                                                                                                                     | `jules-extension.refreshActivities` |

| **Approve Plan**         | Review and approve plans generated by Jules before execution.                                                                                                                                                      | `jules-extension.approvePlan`       |
